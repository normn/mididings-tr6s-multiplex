# mididings-tr6s-multiplex
Quick PoC for multiplexing a single Roland TR6S across multiple channels in detached sound engine mode for use in Renoise primarily. Uses the mididings python library

In this mock-up the Roland TR6S 'Kit' control on channel 10 defines 16 scenes / channels.

On the TR6S you should set 'Utility > Sw: Off' and 'Utility > Kit Control: Patten' to allow kit control via program changes on channel 10 aka Pattern select.
